# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The initial PyBer analysis required creating visualizations of rideshare data to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. After the analysis was presented, a brand new assignment was requested by the CEO of PyBer in order to analyze and display the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Matplotlib, the objective was to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The final analysis results below summarizes how the data differs by city type.   

## Analysis Results

* PyBer's Ride-Sharing Summary by City Type

More than half of PyBer's business are concentrated in the Urban areas making it the most lucrative nieghborhood out of the three different city types. With a total ride count of 1,625 the average fare per ride is $24.53. With a total driver count of 2,405 the average fare per driver is $16.57. This demonstrate PyBer's ride-sharing services are definitely more affordable and accessible in the urban city type.

The Suburban areas comes to a second place bringing in almost one third of the business. With a total ride count of 625 the average fare per ride is $30.97. With a total driver count of 490 the average fare per driver is $39.50. 

The Rural areas shows the least amount of activity and revenue. With a total ride count of only 125 the average fare per ride is $34.62. With a total driver count of just 78 the average fare per driver is $55.49. 


* PyBer's Total Weekly Fare by City Type

In this graph we can see the total weekly fares for each city type between the months of January to April. Similar outcome to the above summary is displayed here with the urban areas contributing the highest weekly revenue over the three different city types, followed by the suburban areas, then the rural areas.

## Overall Summary
Based on the analysis results, there is quite a disparity in the ride-sharing services among the three city types. There is an opportunity to grow the ride-sharing services in the two underserved neighborhoods, the suburban and rural areas. Increasing the total driver count in the suburban and rural areas would increase the accessibility of PyBer's ride-sharing service. More available drivers would allow the service being provided. Assuming the total ride counts being the same, this would decrease the average fare per driver which would also determine the affordability of the service. Assuming the total ride counts would increase due to more available drivers, this would in turn increase the total revenue in fares which may have minimal or may not have much of an impact on the average fare per ride. Although the total revenue in fares are showing quite a difference between the three city types, as we can see in the average fare per ride, they are not too far apart in comparison ranging from roughly $4 - $10 in variances. Therefore, we can recommend that increasing the driver count in the underserved neighborhoods can adress both the accessibility and affordability of PyBer's ride-sharing service.
